# Knock Knock - Video Calling Doorbell
> This Project is developed using a Raspberry Pi, Google Duo and Python.

- When the doorbell button is pressed the Pi makes a high-quality video call using Google Duo, which can be answered on a phone, tablet or computer, letting you see and speak to callers when you're away from home. It works over Internet.

- It also sounds a standard doorbell inside the house as a fail-safe, in case the call can't be taken.
